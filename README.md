CardboardEffect.js
==================

CardboardEffect.js has been removed from Three.js.

This is required for pseudo cardboard effects until native WebVR distortion is available for cardboard devices on Android.

The VREffect.js for WebVR does not add distortion for Cardboard type glasses and renders as stereoscopic.
